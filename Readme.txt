Social Network Analysis 

Overview
This project analyzes a real-world social network on Bluesky using Python & Gephi, focusing on Mark Hamill's followers network.  
The goal is to identify key influencers, detect clusters, analyze community structures, and measure network connectivity.

Technologies Used
- Python (Data Collection, Preprocessing)
- Pandas (Data Processing)
- Gender Prediction** (Using `gender-guesser`)
- Gephi (Visualization & Community Detection)
- Network Analysis Metrics (PageRank, Centrality, Modularity)


Key Analysis
- Network Metrics: Degree distribution, clustering coefficient, graph density  
- Centrality Measures: Betweenness, Eigenvector, Closeness  
- Community Detection: Modularity & Louvain Algorithm  
- Gender Analysis & Homophily: Understanding male vs. female interactions
